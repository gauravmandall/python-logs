RULES for defining a variable name  -> Also applies to other identifiers
    -> A variable name can contain  alphabets, digits and underscores
    -> A variable name can only start with an alphabet and underscore
    -> A variable name can't strart eith a digit or a number
    -> No while space is allowed to be used inside a variable name

# A variable is the name given to a memory location in a program for example :

# a = 'gaurav'        #single quote String
# a = '''gaurav'''    #multiline comment String

a = "gaurav"        #String letral
b = 545             #Integer letral
c = 32.21           #Float letral
d = True
e = None

#  Printing the variables
print(a)
print(b)
print(c)
print(d)

print(" ")
print("~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~")
print(" ")

# Printing the type of variables
print(type(a))
print(type(b))
print(type(c))
print(type(d))
print(type(e))



# variables = container to store a value
