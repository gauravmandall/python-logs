Sets in Python
sets is a collection of non repetitive elements

    s = set()       => No repetion allowed!
    s.add(1)
    s.add(2)        => or set = {1, 2}

->  If you are a programming beginner without much 
    knowledge of mathematical operations on sets, you can 
    simply look at look at sets in python as data types 
    containing unique values :

->  Properties of Sets
        1> Sets are unordered       =>Element's order doesn't matter
        2> Sets are unindexed       =>Cannot access elements by index
        3> There is no way to change items items in sets.
        4> Sets cannot contain duplicate values
